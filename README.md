# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This client was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Dependencies

- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
- [chance](https://chancejs.com/)
- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#overview) Node 5.10.x or above
- [MD5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5)

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Usage

When the server is running, users will be able to see and post tweets of example users. The following features are available:
- Compose a new tweet.
- View list of tweets sorted by newest.
- Hide compose tweet.
- Back-to-top button that appears when scrolling down tweets.
- Desktop and tablet/mobile device friendly.

Keep in mind that this application just simulates tweets and every new tweet composed will be represented with a random userhandle, name and image.
